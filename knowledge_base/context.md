# Agent Session Context

**Last updated:** 2026-07-29
**Current phase:** Milestone 1 approved; Milestone 2 ready to begin
**Active milestone:** Milestone 2 — Platform kernel

## What this project is

Framer for Devs is a backend-agnostic visual frontend and website-operations platform. The CMS is its first and foundational capability. Developers define versioned schemas; clients edit generated multilingual forms; each locale publishes independently; external frontends consume fast published JSON. Future visual sites must bind to the same stable CMS resources without content migration.

## Confirmed stack

- Monorepo: pnpm + Turborepo
- Frontend: React 19 + TanStack Start/Router/Query/Form + Vite
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shared shadcn/ui package
- Backend host: Node.js + Express 5
- API: oRPC with OpenAPI support
- Database: PostgreSQL 18 locally
- ORM/schema: Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: Better Auth
- Runtime validation currently present: Zod
- Required application model moving forward: stable Effect v3
- Required testing direction: Vitest with `@effect/vitest` for Effect code
- Required observability direction: Effect observability + OpenTelemetry-compatible export

The repository is not using Next.js. Better Auth is the correct auth product name.

## Confirmed product decisions

- English (`en`) is required and enabled by default.
- Developers may enable additional BCP 47 locales such as Hindi (`hi`) and Gujarati (`gu`).
- Every content request requires explicit locale.
- Delivery uses strict locale behavior with no silent fallback.
- Locale draft/publish/unpublish state is independent from the start.
- Shared fields are snapshotted per locale publication. A shared-field edit reaches a locale only after that locale is republished.
- Schema changes use draft, validation, change classification, and explicit publication from the start.
- Rich text uses validated structured document JSON.
- Assets are structured external URL references only; no upload/file-management system initially.
- The initial UI exposes one environment named `main`, but all scoped contracts include environment ID.
- Application-owned APIs use the discriminated `{ ok, data, error, message }` union defined in `prd/cms.md`: success has `ok: true`, typed data, and no error; failure has `ok: false`, null data, and a typed structured error.
- Better Auth/protocol-owned endpoints retain native response contracts while participating in centralized observability and safe boundary handling.
- Stable Effect v3 is selected for production reliability.
- Effect v4 and Drizzle's beta/RC native Effect driver are deferred until stable and compatibility-tested.
- Architecture decisions must prioritize goal alignment, correctness, security, reliability, performance, UX, DX, observability, and maintainability.

## Effect research setup

The official Effect skill is installed at:

- `.pi/skills/effect-ts/`

A complete ignored Effect repository checkout is available at:

- `.repos/effect/`

The checkout is currently detached at the stable `effect@3.22.0` source for implementation research. `scripts/prepare-effect.sh` and the root `prepare` script recreate the source checkout when missing. `.repos/effect` is ignored by Git.

Relevant installed skills also include:

- Better Auth best practices
- Drizzle ORM patterns
- PostgreSQL best practices
- Express TypeScript
- TanStack Start/Router/Query
- Turborepo
- shadcn/ui
- React performance and composition
- Web interface guidelines

## Important Effect integration findings

- Better Auth has no official Effect-native integration. Preserve its protocol and wrap session/application calls at an adapter boundary with typed Effects.
- Stable Effect v3 includes `@effect/sql-drizzle`, but compatibility concerns exist around Drizzle 0.45.x.
- Do not change Drizzle or Effect versions speculatively. Milestone 1 must use a tested compatibility approach with stable dependencies.
- The safe baseline is to keep Better Auth's regular Drizzle adapter and expose application database/auth capabilities through typed Effect services.
- Use a shared ManagedRuntime at Express/oRPC boundaries rather than creating/providing Layers per request.
- Use `Effect.fn`, schema-backed tagged errors, Layers, structured logs, spans, metrics, and `@effect/vitest` patterns.

## Current repository state

The repository currently has:

- Basic Better Auth schema and email/password configuration
- Basic sign-in/sign-up/dashboard UI
- Express server mounting Better Auth and oRPC/OpenAPI handlers
- Public health and protected sample procedures
- Drizzle PostgreSQL connection
- Docker Compose for web, server, and PostgreSQL
- Repeatable Vitest integration tests and V8 coverage for the baseline
- Explicit CORS rejection, environment-aware auth cookies, session expiry/refresh tests, and guest-only login routing
- Workspace-wide check, type-check, test, coverage, and build tasks
- Stable Effect 3.22 application runtime with typed services, Layers, errors, and cause handling
- Schema-backed application response/error contracts and deterministic HTTP mapping
- Request correlation, W3C trace continuation, structured redacted logs, bounded metrics, and OpenTelemetry export
- Separate liveness/readiness and graceful ManagedRuntime shutdown

The repository does not yet have:

- CMS domain models
- CMS domain workflows and CMS-specific test suites
- Production telemetry backend/collector deployment
- Workspaces/projects/memberships/permissions
- Locale/schema/content/publication/delivery systems

## Mandatory constraints

- Never generate, push, apply, or run a migration.
- For schema changes, provide migration name and exact commands to the developer, then wait.
- Never commit; the developer manually reviews and commits.
- Complete one milestone and its tests at a time.
- Do not expose `.env`, auth/session secrets, credentials, or content payloads in logs.
- Update `progress.md`, this file, and `learnings.md` as work proceeds.

## Milestone 0 completion

Milestone 0 passed `pnpm run ready`, 26 automated tests, coverage, local runtime checks, Docker health validation, and developer manual review. The developer approved and committed it as `7d5a312` (`feat(m0): harden and validate the application foundation`).

PostgreSQL remains available locally. Docker web/server containers were stopped after successful validation so ports 3000/3001 remain available.

## Milestone 1 completion

- Stable package set: `effect@3.22.0`, `@effect/vitest@0.30.0`, `@effect/platform@0.97.0`, and `@effect/opentelemetry@0.64.0`.
- `packages/api/src/contracts/` owns the schema-backed response and error contracts.
- `packages/api/src/services/` owns typed Drizzle/PostgreSQL and Better Auth session adapters.
- `packages/api/src/observability/` owns request context, redaction, metrics, OpenTelemetry configuration, and safe local trace export.
- `packages/api/src/runtime.ts` owns the shared Layer graph, ManagedRuntime, cause classification, framework execution boundary, and shutdown.
- Application-owned health and oRPC responses use the standard envelope. Better Auth remains protocol-native.
- `knowledge_base/decisions/m1-effect-boundaries.md` records compatibility and observability decisions.
- The developer manually verified the anonymous protected-route failure contract, approved Milestone 1, and committed it as `c28f6fa` (`feat(m1): add Effect runtime, typed errors, and observability`).

## What to do next

Milestone 2 creates the durable platform kernel:

1. Design workspaces, projects, optional capability state, and the internal `main` environment.
2. Define stable branded IDs, ownership/membership foundations, and audit events.
3. Review tenant boundaries, uniqueness rules, archive behavior, cursor pagination, and required indexes.
4. Present the domain and Drizzle schema design for developer approval before editing the schema.
5. After approval, implement through typed Effect services and application contracts with isolation and concurrency tests.
6. Provide the `create_platform_kernel` migration commands and stop for the developer to generate and apply the migration.

PostgreSQL remains running. Milestone 2 is expected to require a database migration; the agent must never generate or apply it.
